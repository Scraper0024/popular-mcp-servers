# Most Popular Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers

This repository contains a curated list of the most popular Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers based on usage data from [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai/).

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. It allows AI assistants like Claude to access external tools, data sources, and APIs.
